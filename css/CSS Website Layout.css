/* Header
A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name: */

.header {
  background-color: #F1F1F1;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}

/* Navigation Bar
A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website:
 */


 /* The navbar container */
.topnav {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

/* Navbar links */
.topnav a {
  float: left;
  display: block;
  color: #f2f2f2;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Links - change color on hover */
.topnav a:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
  color: black;
}

/* Content
The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

 */

 /* Create three equal columns that float next to each other */
.column {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%;
}

/* Clear floats after the columns */
.row:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}

/* Responsive layout - makes the three columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other on smaller screens (600px wide or less) */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .column {
    width: 100%;
  }
}


/* Unequal Columns
The main content is the biggest and the most important part of your site.

It is common with unequal column widths, so that most of the space is reserved for the main content. The side content (if any) is often used as an alternative navigation or to specify information relevant to the main content. Change the widths as you like, only remember that it should add up to 100% in total:
 */


 Example
.column {
  float: left;
}

/* Left and right column */
.column.side {
  width: 25%;
}

/* Middle column */
.column.middle {
  width: 50%;
}

/* Responsive layout - makes the three columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .column.side, .column.middle {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
