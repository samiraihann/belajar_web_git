/* Automatic Numbering With Counters
CSS counters are like "variables". The variable values can be incremented by CSS rules (which will track how many times they are used). */

body {
  counter-reset: section;

  content: "Section " counter(section) ": ";

/* Nesting Counters
The following example creates one counter for the page (section) and one counter for each <h1> element (subsection). The "section" counter will be counted for each <h1> element with "Section <value of the section counter>.", and the "subsection" counter will be counted for each <h2> element with "<value of the section counter>.<value of the subsection counter>": */

body {
  counter-reset: section;
}

h1 {
  counter-reset: subsection;
}

h1::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: "Section " counter(section) ". ";
}

h2::before {
  counter-increment: subsection;
  content: counter(section) "." counter(subsection) " ";
