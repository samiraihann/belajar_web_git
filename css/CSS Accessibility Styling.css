/* CSS Accessibility Styling
Good CSS styling should help all users interact with your website, including those with visual or mobility challenges.

1. Use Visible Focus Indicators
The CSS :focus pseudo-class is used to select and style the element that gets focus.

Always use the :focus state so that keyboard and screen reader users can see which element is active. */

a:focus,
button:focus,
input:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* 2. Provide High Contrast
Always use high contrast between text and background to ensure readability. */

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #000000;
}


body {
  background-color: #eeeeee;
  color: #cccccc;
}
