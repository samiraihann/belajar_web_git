/* The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

Example
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 
 */

 /* The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Example
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 
 */

 #para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/* The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 
*/

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/* Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 
 */

 p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/* Example
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": 
 *

 <p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
*/


/* The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 
 */

 * {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

/* The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):
 */

 h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

/* Example
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: 
 */
 h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
