/* 3 Digit HEX Value
Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.

The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.

The 3-digit hex code has the following form:

#rgb

Where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.

The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.

Here is an example:

Example */

body {
  background-color: #fc9; /* same as #ffcc99 */
}

h1 {
  color: #f0f; /* same as #ff00ff */
}

p {
  color: #b58; /* same as #bb5588 */
}
