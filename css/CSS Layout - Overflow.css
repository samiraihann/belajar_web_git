/* overflow: visible
By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:

 */

 div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 65px;
  background-color: coral;
  overflow: visible;
}

/* overflow: hidden
With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden: */

div {
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* overflow: scroll
Setting the value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it): */

div {
  overflow: scroll;
}

/* overflow: auto
The auto value is similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary: */

div {
  overflow: auto;
}

/* overflow-x and overflow-y
The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):

overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content. */

div {
  overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide horizontal scrollbar */
  overflow-y: scroll; /* Add vertical scrollbar */
}
